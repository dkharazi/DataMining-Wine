The code should take between 5-10 minutes to compile. Please be patient during code compilation.

Where to put input data (income dataset):
After opening the provided R code, the user should change the directory or the input data, which can be done by modifying the “read_csv” command. If the user changed the input data from a .csv format, he or she should change it back in order for the command to function properly. Additionally, the user should ensure the entire set of packages are properly installed, in order to open/read the input data properly. The set of packages can be found under the “Libraries” header in the markdown file.

Please prefer the HTML-formatted file or the markdown file during compilation for an entire analytical overview of the “wine.csv” dataset, rather than only compiling the r-code. The R-code doesn’t contain any data summaries, whereas the markdown file contains a thorough analysis of the data. Please refer to the report if you have any further questions.
