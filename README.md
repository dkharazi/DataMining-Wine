## Overview

This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). The dataset can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). The original data was donated to the University of California of Irvine by the Institute of Pharmaceutical and Food Analysis and Technologies on January 7, 1991, and is available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy, but derived from three different cultivars.

## Variable Descriptions
- `ID:` An ID number for the observed wine.
- `fx_acidity:` The fixed acidity, which is a measurement of the fixed acids in the wine. Most of the acids involved with wine are fixed acids.
- `vol_acidity:` The volatile acidity, which is a measurement of the volatile acids in the wine. At higher levels, volatile acids can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.
- `citric_acid:` The amount of citric acid in the wine. Citric acids are usually found in small quantities, and they are known to add "freshness" and a sweet, citrous flavor to wine.
- `resid_sugar:` The amount of residual sugars in the wine.
- `chlorides:` The amount of chlorides in the wine.
- `free_sulf_d:` The amount of free sulfur dioxides in the wine.
- `tot_sulf_d:` The amount of total sulfur dioxides in the wine.
- `density:` The density of the wine.
- `pH:` The pH level of the wine.
- `sulph:` The amount of sulfur dioxide in the wine.
- `alcohol:` The amount of alcohol in the wine.
- `quality:` The quality of the wine.
- `class:` The class that the wine is considered.
